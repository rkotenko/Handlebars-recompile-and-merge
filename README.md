Handlebars-recompile-and-merge
==============================

A simple php script that precompiles all handlebar templates and merges them into one js file. I wrote this so I could easily add templates and quickly produce their combined compiled version without needing to type the new ones into the command.

Search directory can easily be changed to suit whatever directory struture needed.
